# Our project is a website based gaming platform in which you click the apple in the center to increment the number on the left. As you get more and more apples, you can buy the upgrades on the right by clicking the little numbers in boxes. The upgrades will add a multiplier per second to your clicking, so even if you stop clicking your apple the number will still increase. If you want to stop playing or just want to save your progress, click the save button at the bottom. All user's scores are saved and the top 25 scores can be seen on the Leaderboard page which you can access by pressing the button on the top of the screen. If you would like to read the description of the game you can go to the About page which is also located at the top.
