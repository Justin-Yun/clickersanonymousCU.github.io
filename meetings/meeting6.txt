Went over Milestone 5. 

Spoke about moving over to Heroku and switching our methods around. Talked about priorities and what our flow of development is going
to look like from now to the end of the semester. Went over the template we are starting with so that everyone is on the same page. Talked
about some possible changes to the complexity of the game itself.
