Discussed data base schema and game mechanics

Data Base Ideas:
	Login and Password
	Database field to store number of clicks so users can save their game

Game mechanics:
	Click on apples to start
	After 10 apples each click gets 2 apples
	At 100 apples build a house with 5 people in it (each click generates 5 apples per house)
	At 5000 apples get a town center (each click is worth 100 apples)
	At 20000 apples get a hospital (each click worth 500 apples)
	At 100000 apples get a university (each click worth 1000 apples)

To do:
